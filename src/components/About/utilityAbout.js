    Jen and Jacob created JJJ Accommodations in 2017 just after the birth of their first son Jude. 
    The business started with just one Airbnb that they poured their hearts and souls into, to make it 
    just perfect for guests from all walks of life. After finding much success in hosting happy guests in 
    their Good Vibes Studio in the Woods, Jen and Jacob expanded to 3 other Airbnbs that are well loved by 
    all who stay there.

    A couple short years later, the business expanded into Airbnb management, Airbnb cleaning 
    and Residential cleaning. Jen and Jacob created a strong team of cleaners who have a keen eye 
    for detail and love what they do! This business means everything to the Friehling Family of 5 and 
    it shows through the hard work and dedication put forth. As a family owned business, each and every 
    client is prioritized and treated as family! Call or text with any questions - you wonâ€™t be disappointed!
